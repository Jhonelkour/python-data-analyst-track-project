# Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

## Project Overview
This project performs statistical hypothesis testing to determine if there are statistically significant differences in goals scored between men's and women's soccer matches.

## Objectives
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
- Perform hypothesis testing on soccer match data
- Calculate test statistics and p-values
- Draw statistically sound conclusions
- Compare goal-scoring patterns between men's and women's soccer

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about soccer matches including:
- Match dates
- Teams (men's and women's)
- Goals scored
- Match outcomes
- Tournament information

## Hypothesis
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no difference in the average number of goals scored in men's and women's soccer matches
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a significant difference in the average number of goals scored between men's and women's soccer matches

## Key Questions Explored
1. Do women's soccer matches have more goals than men's matches?
2. What is the statistical significance of any observed differences?
3. What is the effect size of the difference?
4. Can we reject the null hypothesis with confidence?
